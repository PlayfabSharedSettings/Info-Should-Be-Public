# Info Should Be Public

Info should be free is a simple mod that adds a menu on the left hand, this menu displays information about whoever you "shoot" with the gun on your right hand (hold down grip) then use trigger to shoot at someones rig, then itll display their information on the menu.

The menu title is infact a play on words from Halloween1000Falcon's "CastingShouldBeFree", as he actually made what is the equivalent to this mod (this mod is heavily based off of his), and made it strictly private (for now), so i decided to make my own, and then release it :person_shrugging:

Halloween1000Falcon, if you do not like the name, just simply dm me about it, and ill change it, or if it bothers you so so so much, just lmk and ill take the post down.
